        "paragraph": "Hi, my name is Nikol and I'm a design lover from Bulgaria. I just got my Bachelor's degree in Advertising from New Bulgarian University. I love to relate design with purpose and hence to produce beautiful shapes and experiment with colors. I know how hard that might be and that's exactly why I wanted to put some science in an otherwise creative and intuitional field. Bringing visual sense to people and making them want to interact with my designs is something I could describe as a passion of mine.<br><br>My other hobbies are travelling and exploring new places. I love to observe creations of both nature and art - that's what I usually get motivated of.<br><br>I'm currently seeking a graphic designer role, so if you think I'd be a good match for your team, I'd really like us to catch up on Linkedin!"
